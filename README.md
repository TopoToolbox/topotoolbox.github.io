# TopoToolbox

This is the repository for the TopoToolbox 3 website hosted on GitHub
Pages at https://topotoolbox.github.io. It is built using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). The documentation source files
are in the
[source](https://github.com/TopoToolbox/topotoolbox.github.io/tree/main/source)
directory.

TopoToolbox repositories such as
[pytopotoolbox](https://github.com/TopoToolbox/pytopotoolbox) deploy
documentation to their own GitHub Pages sites
https://topotoolbox.github.io/pytopotoolbox. These appear under the
topotoolbox.github.io domain name, but their source is hosted in the
respective repositories. You can make changes to the documentation of
one the packages in that package's repository.
