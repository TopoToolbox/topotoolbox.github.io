TopoToolbox
===========

TopoToolbox is an open-source software suite for the analysis of
digital elevation models.

Version 3 of TopoToolbox has been redesigned around a C library,
`libtopotoolbox <https://topotoolbox.github.io/libtopotoolbox>`_ that
implements fundamental algorithms for topographic analysis.

Bindings for libtopotoolbox in higher-level languages provide a
user-friendly interface to the library and enable data important and
export, visualization and interaction with the geospatial data
analysis ecosystems of those languages.

Bindings are currently under development for

* `MATLAB <https://github.com/TopoToolbox/topotoolbox3>`_
* `Python <https://topotoolbox.github.io/pytopotoolbox>`_
* `R <https://github.com/TopoToolbox/topotoolboxr>`_

Development of TopoToolbox is managed through the `TopoToolbox
organization <https://github.com/TopoToolbox>`_ on GitHub.
